<!--Asked Sami Sully about setting up responsiveness pages but she deferred to training session for 8/28/2020.>

<!--Worked with tutor Ariel Razon who helped me understand how to force change font color for my name in the nav as well as helping me understand in page linking structure from one page to another on the site.

Ariel also helped me better understand how to structure the elements in the nav bar.>

Jonathan Canales provided me with his Ul class code structure to correctly format the Nav bar elements.

On 8-31-2020, I worked with tutor Andrew Hardemon who helped me with nuanced CSS formatting to include adding in my Horizontal Rule tags under my page headers, adding a border top on my footer for asthetics. He also helped me in troubleshooting my Portfolio page borders and margins.
