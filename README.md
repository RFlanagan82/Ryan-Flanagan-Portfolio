# Ryan-Flanagan-Portfolio

## Description
The portfolio site contained in this repository has been created from the skills I've learned thus far within the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp - Fall 2020 cohort.

This site contains 3 pages to include:

- [Index Page](https://rflanagan82.github.io/Ryan-Flanagan-Portfolio/)
- [Portfolio](https://rflanagan82.github.io/Ryan-Flanagan-Portfolio/portfolio.html)
- [Contact](https://rflanagan82.github.io/Ryan-Flanagan-Portfolio/contact.html)

## Usage
All of the files necessary to run this website are available in [this repository](https://github.com/RFlanagan82/Ryan-Flanagan-Portfolio).

## Outstanding Issues
1. Background image formatting issues on Contact page when I go to a large and medium sized window. Works for x-large.
2. The collapsed nav bar menu icon doesn't extend the nav elements down to select page option.
3. There are a few margin and padding issues on the portfolio page when page is condensed.

## Contributions/Credits
On 8-28-2020, I worked with tutor Ariel Razon who helped me understand a few nuances around CSS formatting such as how to force change font color for my name in the nav as well as helping me understand in page linking structure from one page to another on the site.

Ariel also helped me better understand how to structure the elements in the nav bar.

Jonathan Canales provided me with insights into properly codifying the Ul class code structure in my nav bar.

On 8-31-2020, I worked with tutor Andrew Hardemon who helped me with nuanced CSS formatting to include adding in my Horizontal Rule tags under my page headers, adding a border top on my footer for asthetics. He also helped me in troubleshooting my Portfolio page borders and margins.
